# complete-coding-challenge

This project was my attempt at coding a Play framework web based app in Scala. The program implements WebSockets in an attempt to display stock quote prices in real time utilizing the Yahoo Finance API. Each chart in the UI displays the full name of the stock and the quote price which updates in real time.

Instructions:

1. Clone the project and save it in a safe place
2. In the command shell, change directory to the newly saved folder
3. Type: “sbt run” in the command line and press enter
4. Once the green message generates declaring the local server is up and running, type “http://localhost:9000/” into the url      of an empty browser and load the page
